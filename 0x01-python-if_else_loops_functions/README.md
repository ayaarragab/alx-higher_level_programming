# Python Control Statements and Loops

Control statements and loops are fundamental constructs in programming that enable you to control the flow of your code and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, these constructs provide powerful tools for creating conditional logic and managing iterations.

## Control Statements

### if Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.
### if...else Statement

The if...else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false

### Loops
## while loop

The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

## for Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or range) and execute a block of code for each element.
## break and continue Statements
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
The continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

## else Clause in Loops
Python's loops can have an else clause, which is executed when the loop completes normally (without encountering a break statement).

## Conclusion
Control statements and loops are essential for creating dynamic and efficient programs in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on conditions and perform repetitive tasks with ease. Understanding how to use these constructs will greatly enhance your ability to write effective code.
